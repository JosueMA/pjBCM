This is a work-in-progress project to port the code examples from Lee and Wagenmakers' 2013 textbook [Bayesian Cognitive Modeling: A Practical Course](https://bayesmodels.com/) from MATLAB into Python, using the [pyjags](https://github.com/tmiasko/pyjags) package for interfacing Python code with the JAGS Gibbs sampler.
